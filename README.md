# Mathler Game

React Native implementation of the Mathler game: https://www.mathler.com/

### Features:

- Local storage for saving game state
- Light / Dark mode
- Semi-random function generator
  - In the interest of time I wrote a semi-random generator. I control
    edge cases by manually generating valid combinations
- New game option
- Utils unit testing
- Mocked storage for testing

### TODO

1. Daily puzzle only
2. Test the game hook
3. Add some basic UI tests
4. Make the game available for testing with Expo Go
